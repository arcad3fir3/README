Welcome to my corner of the terminal.

I’m a self-taught cybersecurity learner diving into:
- 🔐 TryHackMe / Hack The Box labs
- 🧠 CTFs & puzzle solving
- 🛠️ Bash, Python, and automation scripts
- 🧰 SOC tools, packet analysis, and threat detection

This repo is a mix of my learning journey, notes to future-me, and things I break and fix along the way.
